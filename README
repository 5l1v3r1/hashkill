1. What is hashkill?
====================

hashkill (stupid name I know) is an open-source password cracker that uses the OpenSSL library to 
crack different types of password hashes.

Basically, its purposes are:

* allow cracking lots of different types of password hashes on linux
* employ easy to use command-line interface
* multithreaded
* SSE2 accelerated
* open-sourced, GPL-licensed

Disadvantages at that moment are that it does not support GPU-based cracking. 



2. Installation
===============

Everything boils down to installing the package prerequisites, ./configure && make && make install.

Please check the INSTALL file.


3. Features
===========

Currently (0.2.4) hashkill supports 4 attack modes:

* Markov attack (default)
* bruteforce
* dictionary
* hybrid (dictionary+bruteforce)

hashkill supports sessions (e.g interrupted session can be restored)

Currently there are 31 plugins that can crack 35 different hash types.

And lots of bugs probably but it's still an early version :)
