Software prerequisites:
=======================

hashkill is linux software and unfortunately not portable at that moment.


To install hashkill, you need to have the following packages installed:

make
pkg-config
libc6 headers (libc6-dev)
openssl >=0.9.8
openssl headers (openssl-dev?)
zlib (zlib1g in Debian)
zlib headers (zlib1g-dev in Debian)
gcc


Hardware requirements:
======================

A (decent) x86/x86_64 machine
hashkill is multi-threaded, so you'll benefit from multicore machines




Installation
============

1) download hashkill-version.tar.gz
2) tar -zxvf hashkill-version.tar.gz
3) cd hashkill-version
4) ./configure && make && make install

if everything is OK, hashkill will be installed in /usr/local/bin by default




Installing with GPU support
============

Please use --with-opencl=<path_to_sdk> to enable OpenCL. For Nvidia just --with-opencl is enough.

For AMD if you have ADL installed, use --with-adl=<path_to_adl>. This will enable thermal monitoring.
